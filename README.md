# Repeat-Aware_mutation_rate_estimator
This repository builds upon the ideas from [this work](https://github.com/medvedevgroup/Repeat-Aware_Substitution_Rate_Estimator/tree/main), with significant optimizations and extensions. It enables faster computation of mutation rates (genomic distances) between two whole genomes, leveraging KMC and other mature tools.
